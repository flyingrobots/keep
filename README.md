# Keep

**Correctness-first content-addressed storage.**

> For a given content identity, Keep must return exactly the bytes named by
> that identity—or refuse.

Keep is a standalone Rust library for durable, content-addressed storage. It is
intended to provide streaming ingestion, content-defined chunking, physical
deduplication, exact range reads, explicit retention, integrity verification,
crash recovery, and garbage collection without relying on Git or subprocesses
in the storage path.

## Status

Keep is at the repository-foundation stage. The crate intentionally exposes no
storage API yet. Identity, format, durability, and recovery contracts will be
specified and tested before implementation claims are made.

## Design boundary

Keep owns physical content storage:

- exact byte identity;
- chunking and physical representation;
- streaming and range reads;
- retention roots and storage generations;
- verification, recovery, compaction, and garbage collection;
- optional storage encryption.

Keep does not own application semantics. In particular, the core library must
remain independent of Echo, Git, Graft, WARP, command-line interfaces, and
application policy.

An application may give stored bytes causal meaning, authority, provenance, or
publication status. Keep reports only what its physical evidence can support.

## Engineering standard

Development is governed by the normative
[Keep Rust Engineering Standard](docs/Rust%20Standards.md). Correctness,
recoverability, auditability, and maintainability outrank performance and
convenience.

Documentation is governed by the
[Keep Documentation Standard](docs/Documentation%20Standards.md), which maps
reader tasks onto Keep's architecture, invariant, format, and recovery
corpus.

The initial implementation will use:

- stable Rust 1.96.0;
- Rust edition 2024;
- one writer and many readers unless a stronger concurrency model is designed;
- synchronous core APIs until a demonstrated consumer requires otherwise;
- versioned, canonical, independently testable durable formats;
- no unsafe Rust in version 1.

## Planned first proof

The first executable vertical will be a Golden File Worldline demonstrating
that Keep can:

1. ingest exact logical bytes;
2. retain and recover multiple nearby versions;
3. reuse stable chunks after an early insertion;
4. read an exact byte range without materializing the whole blob;
5. refuse corrupted or ambiguous storage;
6. recover to a documented lawful state after interruption.

This list is a plan, not a claim of implemented behavior.

## Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Every change must preserve Keep's core
law and satisfy the repository's formatting, linting, testing, and review
standards.
